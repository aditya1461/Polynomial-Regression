
Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable 𝑥 and the dependent variable 𝑦 is modeled as an 𝑛-th degree polynomial. It is a generalization of linear regression where the relationship between the variables is modeled as a polynomial instead of a straight line.

The general form of a polynomial regression model is:

y=β0+β1x+β2x2+β3x3+⋯+β nxn+ϵ

Steps to Perform Polynomial Regression

Data Preparation:


Collect the data and decide the degree of the polynomial to be used.

Prepare the dataset, ensuring it is clean and appropriate for modeling.

Feature Engineering:

Create polynomial features from the original features. For example, if the original feature is x, create 𝑥2,𝑥3,…,𝑥𝑛x2,x3,…,xn for an n-th degree polynomial.

Model Training:

Use a regression algorithm to fit the polynomial model to the data. This involves finding the coefficients 𝛽0,𝛽1,…,𝛽𝑛β 0,β1,…,βn that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.

Visualize the fit of the polynomial curve to understand how well the model captures the underlying trend in the data.


Example in Python
Here is an example of how to perform polynomial regression in Python using the scikit-learn library:

""""
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Sample data
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.array([1.2, 1.9, 3.2, 4.4, 5.5, 7.1, 8.2, 9.3, 10.1, 11.5])

# Polynomial features
degree = 2
poly_features = PolynomialFeatures(degree=degree)
x_poly = poly_features.fit_transform(x)

# Linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x_poly, y)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(x_poly)

# Model evaluation
mse = mean_squared_error(y, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y, y_pred)

print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
print(f'R-squared: {r2}')

# Plotting the results
plt.scatter(x, y, color='blue', label='Data points')
plt.plot(x, y_pred, color='red', label='Polynomial fit')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Polynomial Regression')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
